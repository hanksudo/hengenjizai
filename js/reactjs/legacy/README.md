# ReactJS

2022-10-20: somehow I learn this in 2016, it's very differnet version of React, so I move it to legacy.

## Babel

```bash
npm install --global babel-cli
npm install --save react react-dom babel-preset-react
```

## Command note

```bash
babel --presets react src --watch --out-dir dist
webpack -w
```
